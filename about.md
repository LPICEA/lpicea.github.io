### PI

* Dr. Han Wang is a quantitative plant ecologist. She is interested in mathematically predicting the responses of plants and ecosystems and to environmental changes from first-principles, such as the optimality hypotheses rooted in natural selection. By expanding the role of theory in ecology, she aims to understand the links between the acclimation/adaptation of plant ecophysiological processes, the evolution of plants and the succession of ecosystem and even earth system.

### Graduate students

* Shengchao Qiao is interested in crop growth simulation. He tries to construct a simple crop model (PC model) based on theories and observations with the development of current natural vegetation models. He studies the response of crop growth to environmental conditions and management practices, and the food production risks in the future scenarios.

  Currently, he is working on extending a universal productivity model (proposed by Wang et al.) to predict crop grain yield. At the same time, his work also involves the comparison of differences in harvest index parameterization of different crop models, and the sensitivity analysis of harvest index to different factors, such as fertilization and irrigation, et al.

  Shengchao Qiao is currently studying for an ecology PhD at Tsinghua University.

* Huiying works on the mechanism behind the variations of plant functional traits across time and space, and their predictions based on the theory of first principles. Her research involves the relationships between traits themselves and environment variables, and the prediction of leaf traits using models with the data from fieldwork and collections.

  Currently, she focuses on the relationship between leaf nitrogen and climate variables along altitudinal gradients and predictability of leaf nitrogen with existing models combined. Sheâ€™s also interested in hydraulic traits and its interaction with photosynthetic traits.
