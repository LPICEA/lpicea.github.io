## Education

* 2014-2018 University of Electronic Sci.&Techs of China;

Expected Degree(s): BSc. on electronics.

 

## Experience

 

 Research

* Electronic state of disorders in periodic graphene grain boundaries.      (Jul. 2016-Jul. 2017)  Beijing National Laboratory for Condensed Matter Physics and Institute of Physics, CAS(supported by Undergraduate Innovation Funds, CAS) Supervisor: Prof. Guangyu Zhang 

– My work is mainly about the electronic properties of locally defected periodic grain boundaries in graphene, including the localized states induced by correspondence of disorder and 1D grain boundaries, as well as the resulting effects on the transport properties along a grain boundary. 

* Graphene-based radio frequency devices.      (Jul. 2016-Jul. 2017)  Beijing National Laboratory for Condensed Matter Physics and Institute of Physics, CAS Supervisor: Prof. Guangyu Zhang; Collaborator: Jinchen Wang 

– I participated in this project and contributed to the theoretical part. 

* Research Project on Phase transitions at UESTC.      (Jun. 2015-Jun. 2016) Supervisor: Dr. Yachun Gao 

– I looked into percolation transition process in some lattice and complex network models. 

 

 Teaching

* Teaching assistant of freshmen course, Introductory Programming.      (Sep.2017 - Jan.2018) 



 Development

* Participant of the computational pack WannierTools project.      (Since Sep. 2017) 

– The pack, first written by Quansheng Wu, gives various electronic properties of materials including band structures and topological invariants. My part of contribution is mainly to the Landau gauge calculation. (Package homepage: http://www.wanniertools.com/)
