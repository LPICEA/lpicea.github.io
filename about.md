| ![wang](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LPICEA/lpicea.github.io/master/screenshots/wanghan.jpeg) | Dr. **Han Wang** is a quantitative plant ecologist. She is interested in mathematically predicting the responses of plants and ecosystems and to environmental changes from first-principles, such as the optimality hypotheses rooted in natural selection. By expanding the role of theory in ecology, she aims to understand the links between the acclimation/adaptation of plant ecophysiological processes, the evolution of plants and the succession of ecosystem and even earth system. |

| ![Qiao](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LPICEA/lpicea.github.io/master/screenshots/Qiao.png) | **Shengchao Qiao** is interested in crop growth simulation. He tries to construct a simple crop model (PC model) based on theories and observations with the development of current natural vegetation models. He studies the response of crop growth to environmental conditions and management practices, and the food production risks in the future scenarios. Currently, he is working on extending a universal productivity model (proposed by Wang et al.) to predict crop grain yield. At the same time, his work also involves the comparison of differences in harvest index parameterization of different crop models, and the sensitivity analysis of harvest index to different factors, such as fertilization and irrigation, et al. Shengchao Qiao is currently studying for an ecology PhD at Tsinghua University. |
| ![xu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LPICEA/lpicea.github.io/master/screenshots/xu.jpeg) | **Huiying Xu** works on the mechanism behind the variations of plant functional traits across time and space, and their predictions based on the theory of first principles. Her research involves the relationships between traits themselves and environment variables, and the prediction of leaf traits using models with the data from fieldwork and collections. |

| ![Chu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LPICEA/lpicea.github.io/master/screenshots/Chu.png) | **Yuechen Chu** currently works on plant leaf morphological traits (also known as soft traits) based on the data in China Plant Trait Database. Her work includes trait-trait and trait-environment relationships, as well as plant survival strategies. Moreover, she is interested in unifying the principles behind the whole life system, from gene to biosphere, hoping to be able to combine the studies in genetics, physiology, evolutionary biology and ecology all together someday. Besides all living creatures and puzzles, she also loves dance and dark cooking. |

| ![wangrunxi](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LPICEA/lpicea.github.io/master/screenshots/wangrunxi.png) | **Runxi Wang** holds very broad research interests in the ecology of insects and plants, major focus on the community assembly process across sales, and he is a PhD candidate at the University of Hong Kong now. Toward the theory of ecosystem, he is particularly interested in how insect modified the environment and the insect-plant interaction. Therefore, after taking part in the fieldwork and symposium for several times, he joined LPICEA as the external member. Here, he is trying to develop the ecosystem functional based theory and models to explain ‘*how the little things run the world’*  (Wilson, 1987). And he also loves hiking, photography and designing.

| ![Tan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LPICEA/lpicea.github.io/master/screenshots/testpic.jpg) | **Shen Tan**  got his PhD degree in the Institute of Remote Sensing and Digital Earth, Chinese Academy of Sciences (RADI, CAS), with a background of RS-based evapotranspiration (ET) estimation. During the pos-doc period, his interest will keep concentrating upon ET, but with a new strategy combining the plant eco-physiological processes. Additionally, he will also try to do some work in the combination of P-model with RS methods and data, which is also an important step in the model application in agriculture. He likes many kinds of sports, such as basketball and swimming. |
