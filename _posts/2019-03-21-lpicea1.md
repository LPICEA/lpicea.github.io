The lecture shows the development of vegetation models, from the very first static model to dynamic model and next-generation vegetation models, with an emphasis on how plant functional types(PFTs) are brought into vegetation models and its limitation when solving global scale problems. The universal production based models, however, have the potential to join the separated parts together and predict behaviors of plants with a small number of parameters.
